# 🌀 Flowkick

**Flowkick** is a local-first CLI tool to help developers quickly log their work, thoughts, wins, and blockers — without leaving the terminal.

It’s built with a simple goal:  
> ✏️ Help developers capture what they do, so they can show it later.

Whether it's for standups, retros, 1-on-1s, or performance reviews, Flowkick aims to make your invisible work visible — *without adding overhead*.

## 🚧 Status: Very Early & Experimental

This started as a learning project (mainly Go, Bubble Tea, and TUI/CLI design). Right now it’s:

- 🧪 A sandbox for testing ideas
- 🧼 Not production-ready
- 🤓 Mostly for me to explore and document my own work habits

That said — I’m building it in the open.  
Feel free to watch or star the repo if you're curious where it goes!

## 🧭 Why I'm Building This

Developers often:
- Struggle to remember what they did all week
- Undercommunicate their value in standups and reviews
- Lose track of blockers or small wins

Flowkick is my attempt to fix that — by making **note-taking feel like second nature**, not a chore.

## 🎯 Eventual Goals

- 🚀 Stay entirely in the terminal
- 🧠 Guide good reflection with minimal friction
- 🔐 Keep all data private (local SQLite or JSON)
- 🛠️ Fast to use, easy to install
- 🤖 Optionally use AI (like AWS Bedrock) for summaries

## 🙏 Why It’s Public Already

This repo isn’t polished. You’ll find rough code, broken things, and dead ends.  
But sharing early:
- Keeps me accountable
- Helps me think in public
- Might resonate with others building similar tools
