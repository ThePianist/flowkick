# Flowkick

Flowkick is a simple CLI tool for logging daily developer work — wins, blockers, notes — in a local-first and privacy-respecting way.

This started as a Go learning project, and right now it's very early. I'm experimenting with ideas to make it easier for developers to track what they've done without breaking flow — especially for standups, retros, or performance reviews.

**Status:** experimental, not production-ready. Mostly for me to practice Go and play with developer workflows.  
We'll see where it goes!

### Not ready yet

Feel free to watch the repo if you're curious, but there's not much to try just yet.
